#Introduction

It's not only humans who take on debt to manage their necessities; countries may also incur debt to manage their economies. For instance, infrastructure spending is a significant investment necessary for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is an organization that extends loans to countries.

In this project, I will analyze international debt data from The World Bank. The dataset includes information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories.

# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to address questions such as:

1. What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2. Which country possesses the highest amount of debt, and what is the corresponding figure?
3. What is the average debt amount owed by countries, considering various debt indicators?
 
# Finding the number of distinct countries
The count of distinct countries was used to determine the total number of nations that borrowed money from the World Bank.

# Finding out the distinct debt indicators
The unique column in this table is the Indicator Code. The count of distinct values in this column was utilized to identify the distinct debt indicators. The query results reveal that there are 24 unique debt indicator codes. Consequently, there are only 24 types of debt being issued by the World Bank to various countries.

The query result indicates that the total average debt owed by the world countries is $3,079,734.49. This translates to three million seventy-nine thousand seven hundred and thirty-four dollars and forty-nine cents.

# Highest Principal repayment  
The query identified China as the country with the highest principal repayment, and the corresponding debt indicator is "Principal repayments on external debt, long-term (AMT, current US$)." This indicator is also consistent with the average calculation across various debt indicators.
